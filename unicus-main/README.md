# Unicus Watch

This is the monorepo for Unicus watch. The monorepo consists of two folders: `/dapp` and `/backend`.

## DAPP

Holds all files pertaining to the frontend. The Frontend will be done in `NextJS` using relevant libraries to help make the DAPP easier to use.

Deployment of the dapp will be in Vercel.

## BACKEND

Contracts are held in this folder as well as any relevant tests and deployment scripts.
We will be using `hardhat` to compile test and deploy the contracts.
